After conducting data profiling, the dataset used for this analysis was found to be well-structured and consistent, with no significant issues that could impede analysis or interpretation. The data is in a standardized format, follows consistent naming conventions, and contains all required fields. The data values are accurate, columns are assigned appropriate data types, and there are no duplicate records. There were some NULL values in “Timely response” and “Company Public Response” column and this missing vales actually represents complaints that are still in progress and a result of that, the NULL values were replaced with ‘In progress’ using the code below respectively;

- Timely response Column
```SQL
UPDATE 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
SET 
	Timely_Response = 'In progress'
WHERE
	Timely_Response IS NULL
```
- Company Public Response Column
```SQL
UPDATE
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
SET 
	Company_public_response = 'In progress'
WHERE
	Company_public_response IS NULL
```
The following procedures were carried out during the data processing phase.
#### 1.	Created New column
Several new columns were added to enhance the dataset and enable more detailed analysis. These new columns included:
-	Month Name: This column represents the month name in which each consumers submitted a complain to the company. 
Below is the SQL code used to create and update the column;
```SQL
ALTER TABLE 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
ADD 
	Month_Name VARCHAR(50)
```
```SQL
UPDATE 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
SET 
	Month_Name = DATENAME (MONTH, Date_submitted)
```
-	Month Number: This column represents the month number in which each consumers submitted a complain to the company 
Below is the SQL code used to create and update the column;
```SQL
ALTER TABLE 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
ADD 
	Month_Number INT

	[Year] = YEAR (Date_submitted)
```

## Data Analysis and Insight
The objectives of this analysis is the provide answers to the following questions:
1.	Do consumer complaints show any seasonal patterns?
2.	Which products present the most complaints? What are its most common issues?
3.	How are complaints typically resolved?
4.	Can you learn anything from the complaints with untimely responses?

#### 1.	Do consumer complaints show any seasonal patterns?
This question seeks to explore whether the frequency and nature of consumer complaints related to financial products and services vary according to specific times of the year. Seasonal patterns in consumer complaints can provide valuable insights into underlying consumer behavior, potential issues with products or services, and external factors that may influence complaints.

Recognizing seasonal patterns can aid in better planning and response strategies by the organization. For instance, if complaints typically rise during certain months, the company can prepare by increasing staff or resources during those times to handle the volume more efficiently.

Additionally, insights gained from seasonal patterns may inform product development and marketing strategies, addressing common consumer issues proactively.

In summary, exploring whether consumer complaints show any seasonal patterns involves analyzing complaint data over time to identify predictable fluctuations. This understanding can lead to improved customer service and operational efficiency by anticipating consumer needs and concerns during peak complaint periods.

This analysis is crucial for financial institutions like Bank of America as it directly impacts their ability to maintain customer satisfaction and effectively manage consumer relations.
-	Consumer Complaints across Each Month
``` SQL
SELECT 
	Month_Name,
COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Complaints]
FROM
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
GROUP BY 
	Month_Name, 
	Month_Number
ORDER BY 
	Month_Number ASC
```
| Month_Name | Total No of Complaints |
|------------|------------------------|
| January    | 4883                   |
| February   | 4602                   |
| March      | 5335                   |
| April      | 5386                   |
| May        | 5608                   |
| June       | 5575                   |
| July       | 6474                   |
| August     | 5684                   |
| September  | 4765                   |
| October    | 4902                   |
| November   | 4626                   |
| December   | 4676                   |

##### Key Insights:
-	July had the highest number of complaints, with 6,474 complaints submitted, representing the peak in consumer dissatisfaction during the year.
-	September received the lowest number of complaints at 4,765, indicating a potential seasonal dip in issues or an improved customer experience during that month.
-	May and June saw consistently high numbers, with 5,608 and 5,575 complaints, respectively. This might reflect recurring issues during mid-year periods.
-	The first quarter of the year (January to March) exhibited moderate fluctuations, starting with 4,883 complaints in January, peaking at 5,335 in March.
-	After the peak in July, complaints began to taper off toward the end of the year, with November and December showing relatively low values at 4,626 and 4,676 complaints, respectively.
##### Conclusion:
The data shows that complaints follow a notable pattern throughout the year, with mid-year months (especially July) experiencing a significant surge. Understanding the reasons behind this spike could be crucial for targeted customer service improvements. On the other hand, September saw the least complaints, which might be investigated further to determine if any customer service improvements or external factors played a role.
A more detailed analysis into the causes of complaints during peak months could help the company to identify recurring issues and improve consumer satisfaction.
-	Consumer Complaints over the Year
``` SQL
SELECT 
	[Year],
COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Complaints]
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
GROUP BY 
	[Year]
ORDER BY 
	[Year] ASC
```
| Year | Total No of Complaints |
|------|------------------------|
| 2017 | 5394                   |
| 2018 | 7872                   |
| 2019 | 7075                   |
| 2020 | 8942                   |
| 2021 | 11149                  |
| 2022 | 12953                  |
| 2023 | 9131                   |

##### Key Insights:
-	Steady Increase in Complaints:
There is a noticeable upward trend in the total number of complaints from 2017 to 2022. Complaints increased significantly from 5,394 in 2017 to a peak of 12,953 in 2022, indicating rising consumer dissatisfaction or a growing customer base.
-	Largest Yearly Increase:
The biggest jump occurred between 2021 and 2022, where complaints surged from 11,149 to 12,953, marking a 16% increase. This could be due to new services or policies that may have triggered more consumer issues, or increased customer interactions.
-	Slight Decline in 2023: In 2023, the number of complaints decreased to 9,131, representing a 29% decline compared to the previous year (2022). This drop might indicate improvements in customer service, operational efficiencies, or other factors that contributed to reducing complaints.
-	Impact of the Pandemic (2020): In 2020, complaints rose to 8,942, a 26% increase compared to 2019. This may be related to disruptions caused by the global pandemic, such as service delays, increased demand for financial services, or operational challenges.
-	Sustained Growth (2017-2021): From 2017 to 2021, there was a 107% growth in complaints (from 5,394 in 2017 to 11,149 in 2021). This trend suggests that consumer issues steadily increased during this period, possibly due to expanding services, more complex financial products, or increased consumer awareness of complaint channels.
##### Conclusion:
The data shows a consistent rise in complaints over time, with the peak in 2022 marking the highest level of consumer dissatisfaction. The subsequent decline in 2023 could be the result of efforts by the company to address the issues or external factors that reduced customer interactions. However, the steady increase in complaints leading up to 2022 indicates that there were underlying issues that need to be addressed over the long term. A further investigation into the root causes of complaints, particularly during high-growth years like 2021 and 2022, could offer actionable insights to improve customer service and reduce complaints in the future.

#### 2.	Which products present the most complaints? What are its most common issues?
This question aims to identify the financial product that receives the highest number of consumer complaints and the specific issues consumers commonly face with that product.
##### Key Points:
-	Product with Most Complaints: The goal is to analyze the dataset to determine which financial product (e.g., credit card, mortgage, loan) is associated with the highest volume of complaints from consumers.
-	Common Issues: After identifying the product, the next step is to uncover the most frequent issues reported, such as billing errors, poor customer service, or problems with account management. This helps pinpoint the key concerns consumers have with that product.
-	Business Value: Understanding which product generates the most complaints and its common issues provides critical insights for improving product quality, addressing customer pain points, and enhancing overall satisfaction.
-	
This brief explanation will help set the context for analyzing the product complaint data.

To determine which products present the most complaints and identify the most common issues related to those products using SQL, the following steps were taken
##### 1.	Identified products with the most complaints
```SQL
SELECT 
	Product,
COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Complaints]
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
GROUP BY 
	Product
ORDER BY 
	[Total No of Complaints] DESC
```

##### Key Insights:
1.	Checking or Savings Account:
-	The majority of consumer complaints, totaling 24,814, were related to checking or savings accounts. This category accounts for the largest proportion of all complaints, highlighting ongoing issues in basic banking services.
-	This high volume of complaints could be due to common problems such as unauthorized transactions, account closures, or service fees, which often impact a broad range of customers.

2.	Credit Card or Prepaid Card:
-	Complaints related to credit cards or prepaid cards rank second, with 16,197 complaints. This indicates significant dissatisfaction in this category, potentially stemming from issues like billing disputes, fraud, or account management.

3.	Credit Reporting and Personal Consumer Reports:
-	The credit reporting category generated 7,710 complaints, which is substantial. Issues in this area might be linked to incorrect credit information, delays in updating credit reports, or disputes over credit scores.

4.	Mortgage:
-	6,601 complaints were related to mortgages, reflecting issues with home financing, such as loan servicing problems, payment disputes, or foreclosures.

5.	Money Transfer and Virtual Currency:
-	With 3,453 complaints, the category covering money transfers, virtual currencies, or money services indicates growing issues in the digital payments sector, such as transaction failures or delays, especially with the rise of cryptocurrencies.

8.	Payday Loan, Title Loan, or Personal Loan:
-	333 complaints were associated with payday loans, title loans, or personal loans, a relatively low number, potentially because these products serve a smaller customer base.

9.	Student Loan:
•	The student loan category had the fewest complaints at just 39. This low figure suggests that fewer issues arise from student loans, or there may be fewer users of this product in the dataset.
##### Conclusion:
The data shows that checking or savings accounts and credit cards generate the majority of consumer complaints, reflecting significant challenges in everyday banking and credit card usage. On the other hand, student loans and personal loans contribute the fewest complaints, which may suggest either fewer users or better service in those areas.

The report indicates that managing accounts and incorrect information on reports are common themes across several product categories. Issues with fraud, scams, and payments are also prevalent across different financial products. The data highlights areas where consumer dissatisfaction is highest, particularly in account management, payment issues, and credit reporting inaccuracies.

#### 3.	How are complaints typically resolved?
This question focuses on understanding the most common ways in which consumer complaints are addressed by the company. It aims to categorize the different resolution methods and determine the most frequently used ones.
##### Key Points:
-	Types of Resolutions: The goal is to identify how complaints are resolved, such as whether they are closed with monetary relief, non-monetary relief, an explanation, or closed without any action.
-	Analysis Focus: By analyzing the resolution types, we can understand the company’s approach to resolving issues and whether customers are generally satisfied with the outcomes.
-	Business Value: Knowing the typical resolution methods helps assess the company's efficiency in handling complaints, as well as areas where improvements might be needed to better satisfy customers.

This explanation sets the stage for analyzing how effectively the company responds to consumer complaints.

To determine how complaints are typically resolved using SQL, I can queried the dataset to group complaints by their resolution status and count the number of occurrences for each type of resolution. Here's an SQL query that helped you achieved this:
```SQL
SELECT 
	Company_response_to_consumer,
COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS Resolution_Count
From 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
GROUP BY 
	Company_response_to_consumer
ORDER BY 
	Resolution_Count DESC
```
| Company Response to Consumer         | Resolution Count |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Closed with explanation               | 41,044           |
| Closed with monetary relief           | 14,697           |
| Closed with non-monetary relief      | 5,273            |
| In progress                           | 1,494            |
| Closed                                | 8                |

The table outlines the different types of responses companies provided to consumer complaints, along with the corresponding resolution counts.
Key Observations:
1.	Closed with Explanation:
-	The majority of complaints, 41,044, were closed with an explanation. This indicates that in most cases, companies provided an explanation to the consumer regarding the issue, without offering any form of compensation (monetary or non-monetary).
-	This category suggests that companies deemed the issue to be sufficiently addressed by offering clarification or justification for the problem raised.

2.	Closed with Monetary Relief:
-	14,697 complaints were resolved with monetary compensation, which could include refunds, adjustments, or other forms of financial redress.
-	This category reflects situations where consumers were compensated financially as part of the resolution process, likely in response to more severe or verifiable issues.

3.	Closed with Non-Monetary Relief:
-	5,273 complaints resulted in non-monetary relief. This could involve actions such as correcting errors, providing services, or making other adjustments to resolve the consumer's concern without direct financial compensation.
-	This category indicates that while no money was offered, companies took some action to address the issue.

4.	In Progress:
-	1,494 complaints are still in progress, meaning they are actively being worked on but have not yet been resolved. This category reflects ongoing cases that may still result in one of the other types of resolutions.

5.	Closed:
-	A very small number of complaints, 8, were simply marked as "closed" with no further information on the resolution or action taken. This might indicate a case where the issue was closed without explanation, relief, or further action.

##### Summary:
The data shows that the majority of consumer complaints were closed with an explanation (nearly 73%), suggesting that many issues may not have warranted compensation but were instead clarified to the consumers. However, a significant portion (approximately 21%) were resolved with either monetary or non-monetary relief, indicating that some cases required more concrete action. The small number of cases still in progress (2.6%) shows that most complaints have been addressed. The very low number of complaints simply marked as "closed" suggests that most cases receive some form of formal resolution.

#### 4.	Can you learn anything from the complaints with untimely responses?
This question explores the insights that can be gained from analyzing complaints where the company failed to respond in a timely manner. It aims to identify patterns or commonalities among these delayed responses.
##### Key Points:
-	Untimely Responses: Focuses on complaints where the company did not meet the expected timeframe for addressing the issue, which may indicate inefficiencies in the complaint resolution process.
-	Learning Opportunities: The analysis can reveal if certain products, issues, or time periods are more prone to untimely responses. This may highlight operational bottlenecks, understaffed periods, or recurring issues that are harder to resolve.
-	Business Value: Understanding the reasons behind untimely responses can help the company improve response times, enhance customer satisfaction, and prevent delays from affecting customer trust.

This explanation will help guide the analysis of complaints with delayed responses and their impact on customer service.
From the dataset, untimely response was qualified with “NO” while timely response was qualified with “YES”

Here’s how you I approached the question:
#####1.	Identified Complaints with Untimely Response

I filtered the complaints where the Timely response column is “NO”.
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
WHERE 
	Timely_response = 'No'
```
This gave all the complaints where the company did not respond in a timely manner. The total number of untimely response was calculated using the code:
```SQL
Select COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Untimely Response]
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints 
```
| Total No of Untimely Responses |
|--------------------------------|
| 62,516                         |

##### 2. Analyze Key Aspects of Complaints with Untimely Response

I went deeper by grouping and summarizing the data based on specific columns like State, Product, and Company response to consumer to find patterns in the untimely responses. 
- **By Product:** Determined which product categories have the most untimely responses.
```SQL
SELECT 
	Product,
COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Untimely Response]
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
WHERE 
	Timely_response = 'No'
GROUP BY 
	Product
ORDER BY 
	[Total No of Untimely Response] DESC
```
| Product                                                             | Total No of Untimely Responses |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Checking or savings account                                          | 867                           |
| Credit card or prepaid card                                         | 689                           |
| Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports | 475                           |
| Debt collection                                                      | 173                           |
| Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service                  | 140                           |
| Vehicle loan or lease                                               | 33                            |
| Mortgage                                                            | 16                            |
| Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan                           | 10                            |

The table highlights the number of untimely responses to consumer complaints across different financial products. Checking or savings accounts have the highest number of delayed responses (867), followed by credit cards or prepaid cards (689) and credit reporting services (475). Other product categories such as debt collection (173) and money transfers or virtual currencies (140) also show notable delays, while vehicle loans (33), mortgages (16), and payday loans (10) have fewer instances of untimely responses.

- **By State:** Identified states with the most untimely responses.
```SQL
SELECT 
	[State],
COUNT 
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Untimely Response]
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
WHERE 
	Timely_response = 'No'
GROUP BY 
	[State]
ORDER BY 
	[Total No of Untimely Response] DESC
```

The table summarizes untimely company responses to consumer complaints. The majority of delayed responses, 1,527, occurred in cases that were closed with an explanation, meaning no compensation was provided but the issue was clarified. 690 responses were delayed for cases closed with monetary relief, where financial compensation was offered. 178 cases were resolved late with non-monetary relief, involving actions like correcting errors without financial compensation. A small number, 8, were marked as simply closed without further details on the resolution.

##### 3. Trends Over Time
I also analyze if there are specific periods with more untimely responses:
**By year:**
```SQL
SELECT 
	[Year],
COUNT
	(Complaint_ID) AS [Total No of Untimely Response]
FROM 
	Financial_Consumer_Complaints
WHERE 
	Timely_response = 'No'
GROUP BY 
	[Year]
ORDER BY 
	[Year] ASC
```
